                <p>Let’s get real for a moment. Love isn’t always the fairy tale we hoped for. Relationships can be a rollercoaster of emotions, and sometimes they leave us feeling lost, disconnected, or even wounded. </p>

                <p>But guess what? You’re not alone. We’ve all been there. We’ve felt the pain of loneliness, the frustration of miscommunication, and the fear that love might slip away. My heart knows that feeling firsthand, that’s why I built the School of Love. </p>

                <p>It’s not just a school, it’s a Sanctuary of Transformation, a place where you can rewrite your love story. Learn that love isn’t just a mystery but a skill you can master. </p>

            <p id="p-h1">For years, I believed that love should effortlessly guide our romantic relationships. However, I learned the hard way that, while love is beautiful, it often isn’t enough for a relationship to thrive.</p>
            
            <p>This belief was tested in my own relationship as me and my partner encountered the same challenges that many long-term couples face:</p>

            <p>• Why isn’t our relationship as effortless as it was in the beginning?</p>
            <p>• Where has our exciting intimacy gone?</p>
            <p>• Is it time to part ways?</p>

            <p>The good news? Love is a skill that anyone can learn — and I will show you how from the empathetic “been there, done that” place.</p>

            <p>As a bestselling author, international speaker, and couples therapist, I’ve had the privilege of working with thousands of couples from diverse backgrounds. Armed with certifications in Integrative Psychotherapy, Imago, EFT, and Systemic therapy, I’m not just your typical couples counselor; I’m a relationship alchemist who turns conflicts into gold.</p>
